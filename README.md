# Mintlayer react test

This repo houses some boilerplate react code - the original repo can be found here https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate

To use this code clone the repo

run 'npm run setup' and then run 'npm start'

## Why have we chosen to use this boilerplate code?

We've chosen to use this boilerplate code to make the test quicker and easier for both you taking the test and us reviewing the test. With that said you're welcome to do whatever you like, don't feel compelled to use this boilerplate.

## What is the test?

The idea of this test is to build a simple project that will interact with the bitfinex API (https://docs.bitfinex.com/docs/rest-public)

You should be able to choose a ticker and display data associated with that ticker (trades/candles/etc...) on a simple UI. There's no need to go over the top with the UI we are looking more at the ability to understand API documentation and the ability to write maintainable code.

There's no need to rush, take as long as you need to get going with the test we know people have other things going on in their life. We expect the test to take 2 or 3hrs in total.
